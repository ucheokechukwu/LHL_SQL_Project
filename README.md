# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
(fill in your description and goals here)

## Process
### (your step 1)
Loading the data. Realizing I need to study long number values as varchar/text.
### (your step 2)
Analyzing the data, trying to understand what it meant. Discovering patterns like the relationship between revenue, unitprice and unit_sold. Asking for more information from mentors. Brainstorming with the team
### (your step 3)
Cleaning the data - removing unnecessary columns with no data, or the same value
### (your step 4)
Restructing the data - creating tables with primary keys like product and visitorLocation that can be used to cross-reference other tables
### (your step 5)
Attempting the questions


## Results
The inventory
The location of site visitors

## Challenges 
Not enough information about what the data meant. 'feeling in the dark' to understand what each column represented, what was useful information or not. e.g. currency values are all USD or blank. 
Incomplete data. So many missing values and blanks. The original products table list doesn't have the information required etc. 

## Future Goals
investigate the patterns I noticed between totalTransactionrevenue in 'all_sessions' and revenue in Analysis. 
split the all_sessions tables into site_specification information and inventory information
populate the products table with more information about category, stock quantity and restocking time.
create a transaction table with columns for visitorID, date, order placed, etc
